# Bank_Loan

# Introduction
Application of EDA in a real business scenario. It also gives a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

# Business Objectives
Aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

# Dataset
The dataset used was the data having information on the current loan applications and the old loan applications to analyse as to which customers will be pay the loan and which are not likely to pay, since the dataset file is too large it could not be uploaded for the reference.
